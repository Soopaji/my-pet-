## 🎮 **About The Game**

**My-Pet-** is not your average Tamagotchi. It's a web-based virtual pet simulator powered by **Google's Gemini AI**. 

You can raise a Cat, Dog, Bird, or Dragon. But be warned: **Personality is included.** Thanks to the AI integration, these pets can hold conversations, remember your chats (via Firebase), and they *will* judge you if you neglect them.

### ✨ **Key Features**
* **🗣️ AI Conversations:** Powered by the Gemini API, chat with your pet in real-time.
* **😡 Sassy Personalities:** They aren't just cute; they can be rude, sarcastic, or demanding.
* **💾 Cloud Save:** Uses **Firebase** to save your pet's state. Don't think refreshing the page will make them forget you didn't feed them!
* **🐾 4 Species:** Choose between a Cat, Dog, Bird, or Dragon.
